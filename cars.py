# 8-14. Cars: 
# Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. 
# The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
# It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
# Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
# such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
